## Self-Evaluation: 
(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I think I deserve a 17/20 for this assignment. I was able to get most of the things to work, minus a couple of things in the arrays section and the password show would toggle to show as text but not toggle back into type password.
## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
I learned a lot about how functions work and interact with each other and I learned how events can make pages much more interactive
### How long it took you to finish this?
It took about 5 hours to complete.
